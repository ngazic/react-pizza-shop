# React pizza shop ordering app

## Description

This simple demonstration app contains:
1. State management using 'react-redux'
2. Routing implemented using 'react-router-dom'
3. Global event bus could be implemented using some libraryes (e.i. [mitt](https://github.com/developit/mitt)), but I decided for simple custom implementation of Pub/Sub pattern using one global eventBus object
4. Styles and theme taken from [Demo pizza theme](http://www.templatemonsterpreview.com/demo/78480.html?_ga=2.215933651.536897203.1595899832-1079675168.1595899832)
